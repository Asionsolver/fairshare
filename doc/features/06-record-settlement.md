# 🤝 Feature: Record a Settlement

This document provides a detailed description of the **Record a Settlement** feature, including its functionality, user flow, and UI components for a group expense management application.

## 1. Overview 🎯

The "Record a Settlement" feature allows a user to log a payment made between two members within a group to settle their outstanding debts. When one member pays another outside the app, this feature is used to record that transaction, thereby updating their mutual balance.

## 2. Key Features ✨

- **List of Payees** 📋: The user is presented with a list of members to whom they currently owe money.
- **Member Selection** 👉: The user can select a specific member from the list to settle up with.
- **Transaction Direction** ⇄: The user can specify the direction of the payment (i.e., whether they paid the member or the member paid them).
- **Amount Specification** 💰: The settlement amount can be manually entered by the user.
- **Optional Note** ✍️: A field is available to add a note for context, such as the reason for the payment.
- **Input Validation** 🛡️: The form validates that a settlement amount has been entered before submission.

## 3. User Flow 🚶‍♀️

A step-by-step breakdown of how a user interacts with this feature:

1.  **Initial Screen** 🖥️

    - The user navigates to the `Record a settlement` screen, likely by clicking a `Settle Up` button.
    - The screen displays the group context (e.g., "Settling up in Weekend Trip").
    - A list of members to whom the user owes money is displayed (e.g., `You owe $5849.75`).
    - The `Record settlement` button is disabled.

2.  **Member Selection** 👇

    - The user taps on a member from the list.
    - The selected member's list item is highlighted.

    - The `Record settlement` button may still be disabled if the amount is zero.

    - Finally, the user clicks the `Record settlement` button to submit the form.
