## ‚úèÔ∏è Feature: Add Individual Expense (With Split Between Two People)

This feature allows users to log an expense shared between themselves and one other person. The user can define how the expense should be split (equally, by percentage, or by exact amount) and who paid for it. This ensures precise tracking of shared personal costs.
