### Step 2: Explore Your Dashboard 📊

The **Dashboard** is your financial command center. Here's a quick look at what you'll see:

- **Total Balance:** Your overall financial status (whether you're owed money, you owe money, or you're all settled up).
- **You are owed:** The total amount others owe you.
- **You owe:** The total amount you owe others.

Initially, these will all be zero. Let's change that!

### Step 3: Create Your First Group 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

Groups are where the magic happens. You can create a group for any purpose, like a trip, your apartment, or just a group of friends.

1.  On your Dashboard, find and click the **"Create new group"** button.
2.  Give your group a fun and descriptive name (e.g., "Kashmir Trip" or "Room 4B Mates").
3.  Add an optional description if you like.
4.  Click **"Create Group"**.
